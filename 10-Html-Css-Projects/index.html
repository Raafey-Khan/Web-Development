        <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
        <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>, widely regarded as the "People's President," was a visionary, scientist, and an inspiration to millions around the world. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, India, Kalam rose from humble beginnings to become one of the most respected figures in Indian history. With a brilliant mind and an unwavering commitment to his country, he played a pivotal role in shaping India's defense and space programs. As a scientist, Kalam made significant contributions to the development of India's first satellite launch vehicle and nuclear capabilities. However, it was his role as the 11th President of India, from 2002 to 2007, that truly cemented his place in the hearts of the people. Dr. Kalam's down-to-earth nature, his passion for education, and his unyielding optimism made him a beloved leader. He was known for his ability to connect with people of all ages and inspire them to dream big and work towards achieving their goals</p>
